## Test environments
* local Windows 8 install, R 3.6.2
* Ubuntu (on travis-ci), R 3.6

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, and no NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
This is a new package and has no downstream dependencies yet

## Other notes
As suggested after a previous attempt, I've expanded the description. I hope
that it will make sense to someone who has never heard of the EDGE server,
but this package is mainly intended for health actuaries, and they will have
some familiarity with the EDGE server and the Department of Health and Human
Services' risk adjustment model.

I did update the version number since the last attempt.
