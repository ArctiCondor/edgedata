## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Updated the description to be more descriptive
* Changed the version number to 0.1.0, which I meant to use the first time
* Updated the weblinks and described what they contain
* Explained all acronyms
* Expanded dataset documentation

## Test environments
* local Windows 8 install, R 3.6.2
* Ubuntu (on travis-ci), R 3.6

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, and no NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
This is a new package and has no downstream dependencies yet
