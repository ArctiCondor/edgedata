Thanks,

The Description field is intended to be a (one paragraph) description
of what the package does and why it may be useful.
* There is no data on the weblink. Please write what kind of data this is
(and what it can be used for).
* Please always explain all acronyms in the description text.
* What is the CMS EDGE DIV process?

Also rxc_hier is hardly a dataset? there is one observation?

Please add more detailed information of the datasets.
Please always describe the vectors of the dataset (how many and how
long?) and the structure (e.g. is it a list/matrix etc.).

Please adapt accordingly and resubmit.

Best,
Martina Schmirl
